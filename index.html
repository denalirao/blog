       <small> 23 Feb. 2015 </small> <br> <br>
         Last weekend, I went on a trip (excursion, actually) to Morocco. The excursion put us up in a super nice hotel that felt kinda insulating...but also was very nice. We ate dinner there the first night, and they had traditional dancers come in (<a href="http://www.casbahdance.org/assets/image0121.png"> Sort of like this </a>). 
         <br><br>

              My first impressions of Morocco outside of the hotel were on a bus ride to the city of Chefchauen, and were mostly of the scenery. It was scenic - fog, classic rolling medium green hills that looked less touched by development/farming than those of Spain, dotted with the cutest livestock I've seen anywhere. The sheep, the goats, even the stray dogs seemed more liberated. It was also nice to see un-manicured grass, one thing I miss in Sevilla.

          Chefchauen itself struck me as both fun and exciting and remarkably peacful. All the walls are painted blue to repel insects, and the doors of houses are color coded for the inhabitants - blue for Andalusian (moors who left spain), green and grey for Berbers, brown for Jews. The streets are too small for cars - instead, donkeys with 5-gallon tanks strapped to their backs plod up and down the brick/mud roads. The word Chefchauen means (approximately) "look at the peaks," because the city is surrounded by three mountains. These were pretty and supposedly have great hiking trails, which we unfortunately didn't have time for. The waterfall on the inside edge of the city walls was big, but peaceful, in keeping with the city's character.

            After lunch, we wandered up and down streets and between markets, working up the courage to haggle. Halfway through our collective first attempt, we realized that though our guides had taught us the rudiments of haggling, they hadn't given us the faintest idea of the going price for anything. We were reduced to guessing, and alternated between offending people with low offers and raising eyebrows with high ones. The statuettes, leather purses, scarves, bracelets, etc. were the same in every street stall, which made it easier. 
            <br><br>
            Most of the transactions we carried out in Spanish. Some of the merchants spoke English, some didn't and <i>only</i> spoke Arabic, French, and Spanish. Speaking Spanish to the Moroccan merchants went more smoothly than it often does with Spaniards, because there was an understanding that this was a second language for both of us (well, my second; their third). The ones we hadn't already offended with too-low offers were friendly, happy to converse, and patient with our tenuous grasp on the haggling process.

                Very soon into our wanderings, it became hard to ignore an interesting phenomenon. Moroccans were really excited that I was Indian. Every fourth street vendor would spot me peering into stalls and exclaim "India!" And I would agree, taken aback by their enthusiasm and unsure of the proper response, and they would stop eveything they were doing to recite names of Bollywood actors. One guy listed off 7 (we both counted on our fingers), and one started singing and dancing. One bowed, raised his hands as for a namaste, and gravely said <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuch_Kuch_Hota_Hai"> Kuch Kuch Hota Hai</a>. I passed one man and we had the conversation I was still confused by but by this point accustomed to; India--Si--Shahrukh Khan!--Si! I later passed him again and said "Shahrukh Khan!" and he grinned from ear to ear, high-fived me, and responded in kind "Amitabh Bhachan!" I finally had time for a longer conversation with one of these India enthusiasts and asked him why Moroccans were such admirers of Shahrukh and Amitabh. Bollywood movies are always on tv, he said (in Spanish), very fun, very good for watching with the family. Hollywood movies are too violent and have "mucho sexo", but Bollywood movies, he smiled, are better, happier, and, I inferred, more suited to a Muslim country and values.

          I really liked chefchauen. Everyone was really friendly and the town felt peaceful despite us hordes of Americans (ps so ashamed of some of them)-maybe it was the blue walls.
       Little boys played soccer in a square and I was jealous. 
       It's sad - all countries follow the same trajectory; industrialize and then you can be environmentally conscious - but the faster ones figured out what's bad for the environment before the others could use those things to industrialize, and now they blame and shame the others for using those things. 
       The tour was nice even though it was raining. The waterfall was beautiful and the surrounding mountains (chefchauen means look at the peaks). The people were really friendly. Small boys would follow you asking you to buy bracelets and things, and were hard to fend off.

            Great place. Tonight was fun. Bar-hopping, tapas-hopping, beer and sangria, people and friends and talk. Earlier in the day, Antonio Pitt (brads competition) drove us back to the hotel after walking (excellent spinach cheese pastry)and buying pipes (haggled just by standing there!) and sitting in the cutest tea shop. It had arches and carvings/plaster work everywhere and cool lamps and hookahs on every table. And tea was good. And was cozy and dim and I want to take Phil there. The Alhambra was beautiful though idk, maybe I'm too desensitized to historic Islamic palaces now. It's like a city though, with everything in it. Nice views and architecture. Lunch buffet good. Bus ride fine. Out for tonight! 

            Breakfast at hotel, packed up, left bags in a room and went off to barrio albaicin. Cutest old neighborhood of granada-where Muslims lived after 1492, with Christians and Jews. Peaceful coexistence, not only between religions but also socioeconomic classes. Apparently there's a great disparity in the area but everyone seemed happy and friendly and it was sunny. This is attributed by some to the tranquility because the roads are too small for cars. The coolest part was this plaza which looked out across a valley to the Alhambra and torre de la vela. In the plaza there were people sitting in front of trees with their goods spread out on cloths in front of them. Necklaces, earrings, the usual, and the sweetest friendliest community atmosphere. An artist gave us free bookmark things depicting the view. A little museum opened into a church. Right next to that was the functioning mosque (most have been turned into churches) for the Muslims in the area. We went to the courtyard, and saw a guy inside praying which felt like a grand invasion of privacy. We wound our way through more of the barrio and saw 16th century church next to 10th century minaret of the mosque that used to be where the church was. When they converted mosques into churches, they kept a) the minarets, as bell towers and b) water reserves (aljibe?) because they were useful. Kept winding down through the streets, past one with the cutest Moroccan-ish market that smelled like india, to the Capilla real, where Los Reyes catolicos, Ferdinand and Isabella, are buried. They both died before it was finished, so their grandson and the then king Carlos 5 put his parents (their daughter and son in law) in there too, as well as his brother who died young. The marble sculptures on top were impressive (Isabella's head looks heavier), and then we went below and saw the caskets, which was cool. Most of the royals are buried in Madrid or wherever they're from, but these two conquered granada and obviously that's what they wanted to be remembered for. They even appear, praying, on the huge gold leafed wall about Jesus and the two st Juans behind the sculptures. The room after that had Ferdinand's sword and Isabella's crown. The crown was what drove it home-she ruled. There were paintings and then we came out into the sun. There was a guy in the next plaza making haunting notes, beautiful music with what looked like dented trash can lids. There was a method to the denting, though. We wandered through more street side markets, Nora bought a pipe and stole me a wallet for dude, etc. I like markets that all have the same things-it makes it so easy to let go of things and also haggle. At the end of the street, we embarked on a brisk uphill walk back to the hotel. There are two cute streams on the side of the path. Lunched, collected stuff, talked, and climbed on the bus.
