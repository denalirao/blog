       <!--
         This weekend, some friends and I went on a trip (excursion, actually) to Morocco. The excursion put us up in a super nice hotel that felt kinda insulating but also was very nice. Cutest livestock. Scenic-classic green hills that look less touched by developments than those of Spain. It's sad - all countries follow the same trajectory; industrialize and then you can be environmentally conscious - but the faster ones figured out what's bad for the environment before the others could use those things to industrialize, and now they blame and shame the others for using those things. Chefchauen was a great city. Walls are painted blue to repel insects. Doors are color coded- blue for andalusian (moors who left spain), green and grey for Berbers, brown for Jews. The tour was nice even though it was raining. The waterfall was beautiful and the surrounding mountains (chefchauen means look at the peaks). The people were really friendly. Small boys would follow you asking you to buy bracelets and things, and were hard to fend off. 
         Everyone was really excited that I was Indian, and not in a creepy way. Every fourth street vendor would spot me in our group and excitedly say "India!" And I would agree, and they would recite names of Bollywood actors. One guy listed off 7 (we both counted on our fingers), and one started singing and dancing. One said Kuch Kuch Hota hai in parting. I passed one once and we had the conversation I was now accustomed to; India--Si--Shahrukh Khan!--Si! I later passed him again and said "ay shahrukh khan!" and he high fived me and responded in kind "amitabh bhachan!" I finally had time for a longer conversation with one of these guys and asked him why Moroccans were so enthused about shahrukh and amitabh. Bollywood movies are always shown on tv, he said (in Spanish), good for watching with the family. Hollywood movies are too violent and have "mucho sexo", but Bollywood movies are cleaner and, I inferred, more suited to a Muslim country and values. 
          I really liked chefchauen. Everyone was really friendly and the town felt peaceful despite us hordes of Americans (ps so ashamed of some of them)-maybe it was the blue walls.
       Little boys played soccer in a square and I was jealous.

            Great place. Tonight was fun. Bar-hopping, tapas-hopping, beer and sangria, people and friends and talk. Earlier in the day, Antonio Pitt (brads competition) drove us back to the hotel after walking (excellent spinach cheese pastry)and buying pipes (haggled just by standing there!) and sitting in the cutest tea shop. It had arches and carvings/plaster work everywhere and cool lamps and hookahs on every table. And tea was good. And was cozy and dim and I want to take Phil there. The Alhambra was beautiful though idk, maybe I'm too desensitized to historic Islamic palaces now. It's like a city though, with everything in it. Nice views and architecture. Lunch buffet good. Bus ride fine. Out for tonight! 

            Breakfast at hotel, packed up, left bags in a room and went off to barrio albaicin. Cutest old neighborhood of granada-where Muslims lived after 1492, with Christians and Jews. Peaceful coexistence, not only between religions but also socioeconomic classes. Apparently there's a great disparity in the area but everyone seemed happy and friendly and it was sunny. This is attributed by some to the tranquility because the roads are too small for cars. The coolest part was this plaza which looked out across a valley to the Alhambra and torre de la vela. In the plaza there were people sitting in front of trees with their goods spread out on cloths in front of them. Necklaces, earrings, the usual, and the sweetest friendliest community atmosphere. An artist gave us free bookmark things depicting the view. A little museum opened into a church. Right next to that was the functioning mosque (most have been turned into churches) for the Muslims in the area. We went to the courtyard, and saw a guy inside praying which felt like a grand invasion of privacy. We wound our way through more of the barrio and saw 16th century church next to 10th century minaret of the mosque that used to be where the church was. When they converted mosques into churches, they kept a) the minarets, as bell towers and b) water reserves (aljibe?) because they were useful. Kept winding down through the streets, past one with the cutest Moroccan-ish market that smelled like india, to the Capilla real, where Los Reyes catolicos, Ferdinand and Isabella, are buried. They both died before it was finished, so their grandson and the then king Carlos 5 put his parents (their daughter and son in law) in there too, as well as his brother who died young. The marble sculptures on top were impressive (Isabella's head looks heavier), and then we went below and saw the caskets, which was cool. Most of the royals are buried in Madrid or wherever they're from, but these two conquered granada and obviously that's what they wanted to be remembered for. They even appear, praying, on the huge gold leafed wall about Jesus and the two st Juans behind the sculptures. The room after that had Ferdinand's sword and Isabella's crown. The crown was what drove it home-she ruled. There were paintings and then we came out into the sun. There was a guy in the next plaza making haunting notes, beautiful music with what looked like dented trash can lids. There was a method to the denting, though. We wandered through more street side markets, Nora bought a pipe and stole me a wallet for dude, etc. I like markets that all have the same things-it makes it so easy to let go of things and also haggle. At the end of the street, we embarked on a brisk uphill walk back to the hotel. There are two cute streams on the side of the path. Lunched, collected stuff, talked, and climbed on the bus.
