             <h4> <center> Three Sevillans Walk into a Bar . . .</center></h4>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;About a third of all Sevillans are <i>deeply</i> affected by flamenco. There are often free flamenco shows in bars, and sitting there as the guitar picks up and the clapping finds its rhythm, you can see these people losing themselves in the music. Their eyes close and some sway, some slap their knees, and all of them somehow innately know when to utter an "Olééé...". I haven't been able to figure out any pattern to when they do it, and I thought of asking one of them but have no idea how I would phrase that question.
              <br><br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;Next week is one of Sevilla's most important weeks of the year - Semana Santa, the week leading up to Easter. The government of Sevilla is really excited. The citizens of Sevilla are less so. Let me explain why. Instead of good ol' chocolate bunnies and eggs, every day people dress up in full robes and pointed hats and parade around the streets carrying ornate pallets with the Virgin Mary and sometimes Jesus. It takes 40 people to carry each one of these <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paso"><i>pasos</i></a>, and there is one from each church. Sevilla is covered in churches. This means the streets become impossible to walk through and the air is filled with the music and incense carried by each procession until 2 in the morning. This is what it looks like: <br><br>

              The government is really excited for all this because a horrendous number of tourists come to Sevilla. The people are not because the city is held hostage for a week. More than a week, if you consider the preparations. They've been building bleachers for people to sit and watch the processions for the past month, taking up most of many plazas. Streets have been sectioned into pedestrian parts and procession parts (always bigger). Cars are banned. <b>They have paved over their only tram line. </b>Just paved it over with asphalt. 
              <br><br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp; Also noteworthy: the people who walk in front of the pasos wear full robes and pointed hats, and look pretty much exactly like the KKK. They are not, our professor explained, they do it for anonymity. Someone pointed out that this is exactly why the KKK did it.    <br><br>

              Sevilla’s different on Sundays. Feels more like a suburb. Everyone's at church, and hungover from Saturday night.

              About one quarter of all spaniards are deeply affected by flamenco. 

              The weather has jumped from 50s to 60s and 70s, and the people have jumped from puffy overcoats to t-shirts.

              &nbsp; &nbsp; Today I ate lunch leaning over my balcony dropping crumbs on the head of the guy on the street trying to hand out flyers. The top of his head had a couple stringy hairs. From the back of his head issued a ponytail and from the front an endless stream of words -- "Hola chico toma en contra (Hello take this against)" - and then they'd push past him and he'd start again with the next person. He'd stand in their ways, strategically intercept certain people, less strategically hit people with flyers, and they all waved/pushed him off. I never figured out what he was against because he never made it that far in his dialogue. Except once. The only time he managed to get his whole sentence out was at an old lady laden with grocery bags who couldn't walk fast enough to cut him off. She ignored him like a champion, though, and I was too engrossed in this turn of events to deconstruct his rapid Spanish sentence. Something about the upcoming elections. I'm sure I'll find out when I go downstairs.

        <center><h3> Reflections on Sevilla and Sevillanos </h3></center>
        <small> 16 March 2015 </small> <br><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; The Spanish are sensitive about their siestas. It seems to be a stereotype in Europe that the Spanish are lazy, and so they are quick to argue that they <i> DO </i> work hard, probably even harder than those other European countries. (This seems to be an especially sore spot with Germany.) If you remark, upon being asked the differences between the US and Spain, that the Spanish way of life is more relaxed -- "No, the siesta makes us <i>more</i> productive!" - "It's healthier!" - "It's natural!". <br><br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; This weekend, too indecisive to commit to a weekend anywhere, I stayed in Sevilla - and it was great! On Friday I went to not one, not two, but three Sevillan museums I hadn't seen yet in these two months. The most interesting by far was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Inquisition"> Spanish Inquisition </a>museum, located underground in the ruins of the castle that was used as the second seat of the Inquisition in Sevilla. (As the Inquisition grew, the first seat was found to be too small. This first seat was also has the dubious honor of being the first seat of the Inquisition in all of Spain.) <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe because it would be too hard to, maybe because they have no interest in doing so, but the Spanish really don't sugar-coat or try to defend the Inquisition at all, despite remaining a fairly Catholic country. The history books wax lyrical about convictions and burnings and every product of the Spanish education system is able to do the same. I appreciate this non-blind faith, though many aspects of the Catholicism practiced here are less orthodox than I expected (more on that later).
          <br><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;Over the course of this weekend I also walked through four "mercadillos" - street markets. Every city/town has a day where the street markets appear, and in Sevilla it's Sunday and spills backward into Saturday. One of these markets took place in front of the Museum of Fine Arts and, as you might have guessed, was all art. Upon learning I was from America, one artist asked me to be his agent in America. I'm now armed with his business card and a calendar of samples of his work, so look out, Boston. <a href="http://arteambulante.blogspot.com.es/"> Here </a> is a link to his blog. <br><br>

The fortress (the Alhambra) also contains a mosque, soldier's quarters, lookout towers, a park...<br> The whole place has some of the most complete Islamic architecture in Spain. Additionally, the Catholic Kings Isabel and Ferdinand are buried here, and you can see their caskets. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Also, in Granada, they give you a free tapa (snack) with every drink you buy, which is pretty awesome.

          <div class="col-md-6"> <br>
            On Thursday, I made a last-minute decision to travel this weekend. On Friday, I got on a bus to Faro, Portugal, a town (with a beach!) 2.5 hours away. Faro is the capital of a region of the southern Portuguese coast called the Algarve, which is known for its cliffs and beaches. <br> 
            I planned to get there on Friday afternoon and leave Saturday afternoon, and catch up on sleep back in Sevilla on Sunday.The day I got there, I wandered around among short white-walled buildings, the marina, some ruins, and "jardim"s -- on tourist maps, even the smallest parks are elevated to gardens. 
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-6">

          </div>
        </div>

        <br> <br>
        The next day, I met three girls (one Australian, one German, and one Taiwanese) at the hostel's breakfast who also wanted to bike to the beach, and we agreed we'd go together. An hour into our ride, we were directed by a couple of returning bikers not to follow the road signs but to turn left at the next roundabout and go behind the airport. When we reached the next roundabout, there were three exits: to the right, straight ahead, and the way we had come. The sign for the beach pointed to the right, so obviously that wasn't it. The one straight ahead said it was <i>to </i> the airport, and I had visions of our little line of bikes stranded on the landing strip. But after chasing each other around the roundabout four times, the majority ruled that we would go straight. After some time we found ourselves on a single-bicycle-wide dirt path -- reassuring because it was clearly not a landing strip, concerning because what would you do if you actually did want to get to the airport? Eventually, we got to a beach and collapsed on the sand.

          <div class="col-md-8">
            Time slowed down at this point. Naps were had by some, sandwiches by others (me). 
            I spent some time trying to figure out the patterns in waves. <br> 
            &nbsp; Big waves crash and little waves emerge out of the leftovers, and fall over themselves trying to catch up to the big ones. Some parts of a wave never crash -- the falling on both sides gets to them first. <br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; A wave can't crash too far out or it'll never make it to shore, but if it tries to go to far in it finds sand under itself instead of water and nothing to make more wave out of, and it fizzles out. <br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; You can't crash too soon after the previous one, because you want to crash on top of it when it's almost done so it propels you forward and your momentum delays its withdrawal. But you can't crash too long after the previous one or you get caught by its withdrawal into the sea and don't get purchase on the shore. <br>
            <br>
            The rocks I picked up on the beach were black and kind of aggressive-looking, which I thought was uncharacteristic of (the small bit of) Portugal that I'd experienced, sunny and friendly and relaxed.

         <small> 23 Feb. 2015 </small> <br> <br>
           Last weekend, I went on a trip (excursion, actually) to Morocco. The excursion put us up in a super nice hotel that felt kinda insulating...but also was very nice. We ate dinner there the first night, and they had traditional dancers come in (<a href="http://www.casbahdance.org/assets/image0121.png"> Sort of like this </a>).

              <div class="col-md-6">
                My first impressions of Morocco outside of the hotel were on a bus ride to the city of Chefchaouen, and were mostly of the scenery. It was scenic - fog, classic rolling medium green hills that looked less touched by development/farming than those of Spain. The sheep, the goats, even the stray dogs seemed more liberated. It was also nice to see un-manicured grass, one thing I miss in Sevilla.

            Chefchauen itself struck me as both exciting and remarkably peaceful. All the walls are painted blue to repel insects, and the doors of houses are color coded for the inhabitants - blue for Andalusian (Moors who left Spain), green and grey for Berbers (natives of Morocco), brown for Jews. The streets are too small for cars - instead, donkeys with 5-gallon tanks strapped to their backs plod up and down the brick/mud roads. The word Chefchaouen means (approximately) "look at the peaks," because the city is surrounded by three mountains. These loomed up behind the houses whenever you got close to the edges of the city. One of them is the origin of a stream that becomes a river and then a waterfall as it passes the city walls.

              After lunch, we wandered up and down streets and between markets, working up the courage to haggle. Halfway through our collective first attempt, we realized that though our guides had taught us the rudiments of haggling, they hadn't given us the faintest idea of the going price for anything. We were reduced to guessing, and alternated between offending people with low offers and raising eyebrows with high ones. The statuettes, leather purses, scarves, bracelets, etc. were the same in every street stall, which made it easier. 
              <br><br>
              Most of the transactions we carried out in Spanish. Some of the merchants spoke English, some didn't and <i>only</i> spoke Arabic, French, and Spanish. Speaking Spanish to the Moroccan merchants went more smoothly than it often does with Spaniards, because there was an understanding that this was a second language for both of us (well, my second; their third). The ones we hadn't already offended with too-low offers were friendly, happy to converse, and patient with our tenuous grasp on the haggling process. 
              <br><br><br>

                <div class="col-md-7">
                  &nbsp; Very soon into our wanderings, it became hard to ignore an interesting phenomenon. Moroccans were really excited that I was Indian. Every fourth street vendor would spot me peering into stalls and exclaim "India!" And I would agree, taken aback by their enthusiasm and unsure of the proper response, and they would stop eveything they were doing to recite names of Bollywood actors. <br><br>
                  &nbsp; &nbsp; One guy listed off 7 (we both counted on our fingers), and one started singing and dancing. One bowed, raised his hands as for a namaste, and gravely said <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuch_Kuch_Hota_Hai"> "Kuch Kuch Hota Hai"</a>. I passed one man and we had the conversation I was still confused by but by this point accustomed to; India--Si--Shahrukh Khan!--Si! I later passed him again and said "Shahrukh Khan!" and he grinned from ear to ear, high-fived me, and responded in kind "Amitabh Bhachchan!" <br><br>
                  &nbsp; I finally had time for a longer conversation with one of these India enthusiasts and asked him why Moroccans were such admirers of Shahrukh and Amitabh. Bollywood movies are always on tv, he said (in Spanish), very fun, very good for watching with the family. Hollywood movies are too violent and have "mucho sexo", but Bollywood movies, he smiled, are better, happier, and more suited to a Muslim country and values.

            I really liked chefchauen. Everyone was really friendly and the town felt peaceful despite us hordes of Americans (ps so ashamed of some of them)-maybe it was the blue walls.
         Little boys played soccer in a square and I was jealous. 
         It's sad - all countries follow the same trajectory; industrialize and then you can be environmentally conscious - but the faster ones figured out what's bad for the environment before the others could use those things to industrialize, and now they blame and shame the others for using those things. 
         The tour was nice even though it was raining. The waterfall was beautiful and the surrounding mountains (chefchauen means look at the peaks). The people were really friendly. Small boys would follow you asking you to buy bracelets and things, and were hard to fend off.

              Great place. Tonight was fun. Bar-hopping, tapas-hopping, beer and sangria, people and friends and talk. Earlier in the day, Antonio Pitt (brads competition) drove us back to the hotel after walking (excellent spinach cheese pastry)and buying pipes (haggled just by standing there!) and sitting in the cutest tea shop. It had arches and carvings/plaster work everywhere and cool lamps and hookahs on every table. And tea was good. And was cozy and dim and I want to take Phil there. The Alhambra was beautiful though idk, maybe I'm too desensitized to historic Islamic palaces now. It's like a city though, with everything in it. Nice views and architecture. Lunch buffet good. Bus ride fine. Out for tonight! 

              Breakfast at hotel, packed up, left bags in a room and went off to barrio albaicin. Cutest old neighborhood of granada-where Muslims lived after 1492, with Christians and Jews. Peaceful coexistence, not only between religions but also socioeconomic classes. Apparently there's a great disparity in the area but everyone seemed happy and friendly and it was sunny. This is attributed by some to the tranquility because the roads are too small for cars. The coolest part was this plaza which looked out across a valley to the Alhambra and torre de la vela. In the plaza there were people sitting in front of trees with their goods spread out on cloths in front of them. Necklaces, earrings, the usual, and the sweetest friendliest community atmosphere. An artist gave us free bookmark things depicting the view. A little museum opened into a church. Right next to that was the functioning mosque (most have been turned into churches) for the Muslims in the area. We went to the courtyard, and saw a guy inside praying which felt like a grand invasion of privacy. We wound our way through more of the barrio and saw 16th century church next to 10th century minaret of the mosque that used to be where the church was. When they converted mosques into churches, they kept a) the minarets, as bell towers and b) water reserves (aljibe?) because they were useful. Kept winding down through the streets, past one with the cutest Moroccan-ish market that smelled like india, to the Capilla real, where Los Reyes catolicos, Ferdinand and Isabella, are buried. They both died before it was finished, so their grandson and the then king Carlos 5 put his parents (their daughter and son in law) in there too, as well as his brother who died young. The marble sculptures on top were impressive (Isabella's head looks heavier), and then we went below and saw the caskets, which was cool. Most of the royals are buried in Madrid or wherever they're from, but these two conquered granada and obviously that's what they wanted to be remembered for. They even appear, praying, on the huge gold leafed wall about Jesus and the two st Juans behind the sculptures. The room after that had Ferdinand's sword and Isabella's crown. The crown was what drove it home-she ruled. There were paintings and then we came out into the sun. There was a guy in the next plaza making haunting notes, beautiful music with what looked like dented trash can lids. There was a method to the denting, though. We wandered through more street side markets, Nora bought a pipe and stole me a wallet for dude, etc. I like markets that all have the same things-it makes it so easy to let go of things and also haggle. At the end of the street, we embarked on a brisk uphill walk back to the hotel. There are two cute streams on the side of the path. Lunched, collected stuff, talked, and climbed on the bus.
